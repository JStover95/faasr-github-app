# Design Documentation

This directory contains design documentation for the Lexica project. These documents serve as a reference for contributors and coding agents, documenting architectural decisions, design patterns, and best practices used throughout the codebase.

Design docs should be added to over time as new patterns emerge and architectural decisions are made. Each document focuses on a specific area or technology used in the project.

## Available Design Docs

- **[Supabase Edge Functions](./supabase.md)** - Design patterns and best practices for Supabase Edge Functions, including error handling, configuration management, and code organization.

- **[Supabase Testing Strategy](./supabase-testing.md)** - Testing patterns and best practices for Supabase Edge Functions, including mock factories, environment management, dependency stubbing, and test structure.
